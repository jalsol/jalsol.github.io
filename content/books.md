### Preface

I've started reading again for quite a while now, after I bought a [used Kindle Paperwhite 4 in Singapore](https://www.carousell.sg/p/kindle-paperwhite-1320674112/) for a very good price (even better than in Vietnam).

These are some of my very short reviews of books I've read. I don't like leaving comments on Goodreads, and I have my own platform, so I'll be leaving my thoughts here. My ratings can be lenient (even trash, perhaps), but I don't care.

Most of them are novels, but there are also technical CS books, and even philosophy books, too. This list does also include books that I read years ago as well, but I would like to put them here.

### **Kimi no Na wa.**

Rating: 5*
<br/>
[*Link to Goodreads*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33960710-your-name)

The anime was great for the 17-year-old me. Not because of the supposedly moving story, but because it was **somewhat relatable** to me: at the time, I also had a love story with a girl that went through time and space (unfortunately, I ended it a few days after I bought the novel).

The novel, using text as a medium, brought some more details to the story that would have otherwise been ignored/not much emphasized on with the animation medium. This is the very reason I started reading novels instead of watching anime. The plot, otherwise, is in fact, still the same as the anime (ofc lmfaoooo).

I gave this one a mid 5*. It was relatable to me. It also introduced me to novels and made me realize why novels are better than anime.

### **Kimi no Na wa. Another Side: Earthbound**

Rating: 5*
<br/>
[*Link to Goodreads*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34213956-your-name-another-side)

An extension of the original. It provided more stories that are told in the perspectives of other characters in Mitsuha's village. It effectively acts as a "prequel", where it explains many of the details in the original story.

It is an extension, obviously it won't make sense without the original. If you are the kind of person who bothers to go look around communities, forums, wikis... after a manga/anime ends to learn more about the details like me, this one is for you.

A light 5* **(in conjunction with the original)**.

### **The Wage of Angel of Death is 300 Yen Per Hour.**

Rating: 5*
<br/>
[*Link to Goodreads*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44172931-th-n-ch-t-l-m-th-m-300-y-n-gi)

I bought the paperback in 2022, before entering college. However, I only decided to read it after I bought my Kindle.

This one made me cry. It is almost **too relatable**. I've suffered from lost ones (and even my very own desire to commit suicide since 2nd grade) a bit more than others.

Although the execution was not the best (hence the lower ratings on Goodreads), the story was still enjoyable and the author tried to put in some messages about life. It managed to get [its own manga](https://myanimelist.net/manga/130380/Jikyuu_300-en_no_Shinigami) with a decent rating on MAL.

A strong 5* because, again, this one is relatable to me.

### **Epictetus - The Complete Works: Handbook, Discourses, and Fragments**

Rating: (reading, but potential 4-5*)
<br/>
[*Link to Goodreads*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60557014-the-complete-works)

Stoicism has been quite a topic nowadays. Unfortunately, people often have a misunderstanding of stoicism, especially those with the "redpill", "alpha male" premise on the internet.

I learned about stoicism from Youtube videos, especially [this video from Pewdiepie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FinMGtpTud0). I had heard about some of the points, thought they made sense, and decided to start reading books that cited Epictetus's teachings. For anyone who wants to have some insights on what stoicism actually is, this book is the one to start (**not** Meditations by Marcus Aurelius).

Keep in mind that Epictetus was not chill. He would roast the shit out of anybody and used slurs against them (despite being a former slave himself). Some of his teachings may not align well with the modern society. You have to adapt his teachings into your world view (thus truly learn), and not just blindly accept/reject them.

This book changed me - in the way that I am able to focus on the right things and remove the unnecessary burdens, in the way that I can control my emotions better.

### **Pain, Pain, Go Away**

Rating: 4*
<br/>
[*Link to Goodreads*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56292942-pain-pain-go-away)

A dark, gloomy one. The theme was... fascinating. I even like the actions in some parts. The plot twist at the end somewhat blew my mind. The chemistry between the protagonists were... interesting?

However, the relationship between them felt weak, odd and even toxic at times. I really don't understand how they developed feelings towards each other (unless Stockholm syndrome is at play here).

A strong 3* to light 4*.

### **My Stepsister is My Ex-Girlfriend**

### **Wait For Me Yesterday in Spring**

Rating: 5*
<br/>
[*Link to Goodreads*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59386448-wait-for-me-yesterday-in-spring)

I read this before [The Tunnel to Summer](#the-tunnel-to-summer-the-exit-of-goodbyes).

It has an interesting time-travelling scheme. I think it's similar to [My Tomorrow, Your Yesterday](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5338222/)? (idk I've only listened to [back number's Happy End](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8y_RsF4TSw) - an OST of the movie).

The story was decent. There was a good chemistry between the protagonists (they are childhood friends). The plot twist at the end and the actions were actually thrilling with some combat involved. A happy ending for everyone.

A mid 5*.

### **Three Days of Happiness**

Rating: 5*
<br/>
[*Link to Goodreads*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53972440-three-days-of-happiness)

GOAT.

It's the best novel I've read so far. It was fun. It was touching. It was beautiful. The execution and the message of the author was top notch. The chemistry between the protagonists was built up nicely.

I do like that the whole premise was pivoted around the "Three Days of Happiness", but in the end, that didn't matter anymore.

A strong 5*. The [manga adaptation](https://myanimelist.net/manga/100448/Jumyou_wo_Kaitotte_Moratta_Ichinen_ni_Tsuki_Ichimanen_de) was well deserved. Maybe even an anime series? Mind you that this novel did not win any award at all.

### **Trading Systems Developer Interview Guide (C++ Edition): Insider's Guide to Top Tech Jobs in Finance**

Rating: 3*
<br/>
[*Link to Goodreads*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57025157-trading-systems-developer-interview-guide-c-edition)

To me, it's a mid book. I expected some more mind-blowing optimization techniques, or some weird C++ stuff. If you are brand new to C++ and low-level optimization, you might learn a thing or two.

Read [Algorithms for Modern Hardware](https://en.algorithmica.org/hpc/) instead.

### **Convenience Store Woman**

Rating: 4*
<br/>
[*Link to Goodreads*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36739755-convenience-store-woman)

A book recommended to me by ChatGPT.

A weird and depressing view of the (Japanese) society, especially from the view of an... unusual Japanese woman. A woman who'd been living with no significant goal other than to serve customers in a convenience store for decades. She didn't even want promotion. She was content with being the same cog in the society, while having an unusual life and an unusual view that went against the social norm.

Don't trust any stupid Western critics when they say this book is "funny", "quirky", "comedic", and so on. You'll see the depressing layer under the surface.

A strong 4*, close to a 5*. Got me thinking but didn't hit me hard in the "society-questioning" regard.

### **The Tunnel to Summer, the Exit of Goodbyes**

Rating: 4*
<br/>
[*Link to Goodreads*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60389438-the-tunnel-to-summer-the-exit-of-goodbyes)

It even has a manga and an anime. I'd been listening to the anime's OSTs - eill's [Finale.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lYb9nLO_FY) and [pre-romance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG7sBQXJWNs), without knowing anything about the anime (even the name)!

There were surely a lot of hype around this one. There were definitely some drives in the main protagonist -- I felt the desire to see one's deceased family member (because he's literally me fr fr).

However, the romantic aspect felt underwhelming. Two random people investigating some random phenomenon and that was enough for them to fall in love?

A strong 4*. Just below 5*.
