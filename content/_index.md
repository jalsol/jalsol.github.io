# ✨just a little spark of light.✨

## who am i?

My (real) name is **<u>Nguyen</u> Quang Truong**. I also have an internet
nickname: **jalsol** (acronym for *"just a little spark of light"*).

You can call me:
- **Truong** (the Vietnamese way);
- **Quang Truong** (the Chinese/Korean/etc. way);
- **jalsol** (my internet nickname).

*I should probably have an English name? I used to have one, but I haven't used
it since childhood.*

My pronouns are **he/him** (ever since birth and will always be).

## what do i do?

I am a student of **APCS @ VNUHCM - University of Science**, class of
2022 - 2026.

I'm also exchanging at **National University of Singapore** during AY2024/2025-S1
(as a VNUHCM representative via **[DiscoverNUS](https://masters.nus.edu.sg/docs/default-source/scholarships-and-financial-aid/nus-asean-master's-scholarship/discovernus-and-nus-asean-master's-scholarship.pdf))**.

## what are these all about?

I like sharing my thoughts on the internet. My online posts usually consist of:
- Personal project sharing;
- Tips and tricks;
- Competition afterthoughts;
- Other thoughts about things in life.

I write blogs in either [English](/tags/english/) (for general blogs) or [Vietnamese](/tags/vietnamese/) (for the local
audience).
